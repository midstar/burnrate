that last person to join the meeting or the meeting organizer to 
setup the projector, skype conference call etc?

Ever wondered how much money that is burned up during waiting time
or how much a meeting will cost the project or company in general?

This web application will give you the answer!

Based on the number of persons and the cost / h per person you will
get a realtime view of the money that is spent. 

# Installation
The application is just a simple html file and some resources. These
are located in the templates folder. Just copy these to your WEB 
server and enjoy.

If you don't have a WEB server there is a small application written
in Golang that will act as a WEB server using the port 8080.
